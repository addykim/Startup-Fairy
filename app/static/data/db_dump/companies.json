It was a huge hit: in 2 weeks, half of the schools in the Boston area began demanding a Facebook network. Zuckerberg immediately recruited his friends [Dustin Moskovitz](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dustin-moskovitz), [Chris Hughes](/person/chris-hughes), and [Eduardo Saverin](/person/eduardo-saverin) to help build Facebook, and within four months, Facebook added 30 more college networks. \r\n\r\nThe original idea for the term Facebook came from Zuckerberg's high school (Phillips Exeter Academy). The Exeter Face Book was passed around to every student as a way for students to get to know their classmates for the following year. It was a physical paper book until Zuckerberg brought it to the internet.\r\n\r\nWith this success, Zuckerberg, Moskowitz and Hughes moved out to [Palo Alto](/maps/city/Palo%2520Alto) for the summer and rented a sublet. A few weeks later, Zuckerberg ran into the former cofounder of [Napster](/company/napster), [Sean Parker](/person/sean-parker). Parker soon moved in to Zuckerberg's apartment and they began working together.  Parker provided the introduction to their first investor, [Peter Thiel](/person/peter-thiel), cofounder of [PayPal](/company/paypal) and managing partner of [The Founders Fund](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/founders-fund). Thiel invested $500,000 into Facebook. \r\n\r\nWith millions more users, [Friendster](/company/friendster) [attempted](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/yahoos-project-fraternity-docs-leaked/) to acquire the company for $10 million in mid 2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/accel-partners), at a valuation of [around $100 million](http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/09/07/85-of-college-students-use-facebook/). Facebook continued to grow, opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding an immensely popular photo sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from [Greylock Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/greylock) and [Meritech Capital](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/meritech-capital-partners), as well as previous investors Accel Partners and Peter Thiel. The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently [opened](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/04/26/facebook-goes-beyond-college-high-school-markets/) up to work networks, eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally in September 2006, Facebook [opened](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/26/facebook-just-launched-open-registrations/) to anyone with an email address. \r\n \r\nIn the summer of 2006, [Yahoo](/company/yahoo) [attempted to acquire](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/21/facebook-and-yahoo-in-acquisition-talks-for-1-billion/) the company for $1 billion dollars. [Reports](http://www.wired.com/techbiz/startups/news/2007/09/ff_facebook) actually indicated that Zuckerberg made a verbal agreement to sell Facebook to Yahoo. A few days later when Yahoo's stock price took a dive, the offer was lowered to $800 million and Zuckerberg walked away from the deal.  Yahoo later [offered](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/yahoos-project-fraternity-docs-leaked/) $1 billion again, this time Zuckerberg turned Yahoo down and earned instant notoriety as the \"kid\" who turned down a billion. This was not the first time Zuckerberg turned down an acquisition offer; [Viacom](/company/viacom) had previously [unsuccessfully](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/03/28/facebook-is-doing-the-skype-dance/) attempted to acquire the company for $750 million in March 2006. \r\n\r\nNot long after, in October 2007, [Microsoft invested](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/24/facebook-takes-the-microsoft-money-and-runs/) $240 million into Facebook for 1.6 percent of the company in. This meant a valuation of over $15 billion, making Facebook the [5th most valuable US Internet company](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/25/perspective-facebook-is-now-5th-most-valuable-us-internet-company/), yet with only $150 million in annual revenue. Many explained Microsoft's decision as being solely driven by the desire to outbid Google.\r\n\r\nFacebook continued to receive funding, most notably in January 2011 receiving a [$1.5 billion round](http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/21/facebook-raises-1-5-billion-at-50-billion-valuation/), valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later, in February 2012, Facebook [announced](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebook-files-for-5-billion-ipo/) that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012, opening on the NASDAQ with shares trading at [$42.05](http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/18/facebook-share-open-10-5-higher-at-42/).\r\n\r\nOne sour note for Facebook has been the [controversy](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/16/the-ghost-of-zuckerbergs-past-may-haunt-facebook-ipo/) with social network ConnectU. The founders of ConnectU, former classmates of Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard, allege that Zuckerberg stole their original source code for Facebook. The ordeal has [gone to court](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/10/facebook-vs-connectu-facebook-makes-untrue-assertions-claims-connectu/), and has now been [resolved](http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/22/after-seven-years-the-winklevosses-give-up-on-battle-with-facebook/). \r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this lingering controversy, Facebook's growth has been staggering. Facebook announced [astonishing numbers](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebooks-s-1-845-million-users-every-month-more-than-half-daily-and-nearly-half-mobile/) in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO. As of July 2013, over [1.15 billion](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/facebook-growth-2/) users log into Facebook every month, and 669 million users log in daily. Mobile users now make up half of Facebook's user base, with 819 million monthly actives. Facebook has also announced that by the end of 2011 there had been 100 billion friend connections, and in recent months users had been registering 2.7 billion Likes and Comments per day. Facebook is one of the [most trafficked sites](http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/29/hitwise-facebook-overtakes-google-to-become-most-visited-website-in-2010/) in the US, and its international growth has been impressive. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day.\r\n\r\nFacebook users' [passion](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/13/i-just-cant-be-a-college-student-without-facebook/)?or [addiction](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/09/career-advice-dont-choose-facebook-over-your-job/)?to the site is unparalleled: more than half use the product every single day and users spend an average of 19 minutes a day on Facebook. The site's popularity has garnered it pop culture fame, so much so that in 2010 a feature film entitled _The Social Network_ was released which chronicled Facebook's inception.\r\n\r\nIn its 2012 [IPO filing](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebook-files-for-5-billion-ipo/), Facebook announced that it intends to grow in the near future by expanding its global user base, increasing engagement by developing new social tools, improving the mobile experience, and creating more value for advertisers and users.", "logo_url": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/crunchbase_prod_assets/assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-250x250.jpg", "id": "c:5"}, {"website": "http://www.omnidrive.com", "city": "Palo Alto", "name": "Omnidrive", "people": [["Nik Cubrilovic", "p:837"], ["Geoff McQueen", "p:62970"], ["Tony Guntharp", "p:48251"], ["Mike Cannon-Brookes", "p:955"]], "twitter": "Nomadesk", "financial_orgs": [["Aydin Senkut", "p:638"], ["Georges Harik", "p:639"], ["Michael Arrington", "p:904"], ["Jeff Clavier", "p:504"]], "summary": "Currently in public beta, Omnidrive makes it easy to access, edit and share your files from any computer with a web browser.

Mahalo includes the most appropriate hand found links and information about for about 10,000 unique queries.  \r\n\r\nBy 2008 the company hoped to reach 25,000 profiles.  Not unsurprisingly, search results are generated at a limited speed, because of the absence of an automated engine.  However, results pages are often very deep and useful.  Searching queries for which a page has not been created are supplemented with Google search results.  Theoretically, Google users shouldn't have a problem switching over.\r\n\r\nResults pages are a mix between a traditional search layout and Wikipedia.  Any factual information is concisely listed to the side of the all links, while links results are split into different categories with the \"top 7\" heading up the page.  Results categories beyond the top 7 are decided upon by Mahalo guides.  These categories are tailored specifically to the search term.  Thus, a search for a person might include a professional profile, statistics for an athlete or a \"gossip\" section for celebrities.  Searches for companies generally include recent news, products or stock information.  Because search results are ultimately subjective, Mahalo allows users to submit their own links for consideration.  These links are voted on and eventually published or not.\r\n\r\nAlthough the manual creation process will force Mahalo to grow its index very slowly, founder Jason Calacanis claims the company can operate for [four years without any revenue](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/30/jason-calacanis-launches-mahalo-today-human-powered-search/).\r\n\r\nMahalo is one of a few substantially funded alternative search engines including [Powerset](http://crunchbase.com/company/powerset), Hakia, [Wikia](http://crunchbase.com/company/wikia), and [ChaCha](http://crunchbase.com/company/chacha).

Readers submit articles in a Digg-like fashion, but don't vote to get the articles on the front page.  Founder Ian Clarke, formerly of video site [Revver](http://crunchbase.com/company/revver), claims that with video as well as news, many people may read articles but few will vote on them.  Clarke hints that the passivity of news and video consumption may ultimately weed out news aggregators that cannot automatically deliver customized news.  However, Thoof users are allowed to edit the news by suggesting alternative links.  If link changes are to stand they must get enough votes from the rest of the community. Thoof has many web 2.0 elements including article tagging, wiki features and aforementioned recommendation engine.  It isn't an exact clone of any one social news site, but can be considered a competitor to sites like [Digg](http://crunchbase.com/company/digg), [Netscape](http://crunchbase.com/company/netscape) and [Y Combinator](http://crunchbase.com/company/y-combinator) company [Reddit](http://crunchbase.com/company/reddit).", "logo_url": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/crunchbase_prod_assets/assets/images/resized/0000/4462/4462v1-max-250x250.png", "id": "c:43"}, {"website": "http://jinglenetworks.com", "city": "New York", "name": "Jingle Networks", "people": [["Annita Tanini", "p:49124"], ["Greg White", "p:13822"], ["Joanne Bryce", "p:239907"], ["Louis Toth", "p:3239"], ["David Berkman", "p:48664"], ["Brian Roberts", "p:4565"], ["Scott Bruce", "p:48663"], ["Chip Hazard", "p:7713"], ["Joshua Kopelman", "p:235535"], ["Scott Kliger", "p:137"], ["Ken Bronfin", "p:49123"]], "twitter": "Marchex", "financial_orgs": [["Liberty Associated Partners", "f:38"], ["Lead Dog Ventures", "f:695"], ["IDG Ventures", "f:1275"], ["First Round Capital", "f:29"], ["Hearst Ventures", "f:1287"], ["Comcast Ventures", "f:503"], ["Goldman Sachs", "f:36"], ["Flybridge Capital Partners", "f:64"], ["Rose Tech Ventures", "f:1396"]], "summary": "Jingle Networks is the leading provider of advertising and technology solutions for voice and mobile business search.

As part of the Music Genome Project, over 400 different musical attributes are considered when selecting the next song. These 400 attributes are combined into larger groups called focus traits. There are 2,000 focus traits. Examples of these are rhythm syncopation, key tonality, vocal harmonies, and displayed instrumental proficiency.\r\n\r\nThe Music Genome Project is what powers Pandora's personalization, as it is a detailed, hand-built musical taxonomy. Using this musicological \u0093DNA\u0094 and constant listener feedback Pandora crafts personalized stations from the more than 800,000 songs that have been analyzed since the project began in January 2000. More than 75 million people throughout the United States listen to personalized radio stations for free on Pandora through their PCs, mobile phones and devices such as the iPad, and connected in-house devices ranging from TVs to set-top boxes to Blu-Ray players.\r\n\r\nMobile technology has been a significant factor in the growth and popularity of Pandora, starting with the introduction of the Apple app store for the iPhone in the Summer of 2008.

Since more than 50% of radio listening happens in the car, this was a crucial arena for Pandora.\r\n\r\nAlso in 2009, Pandora announced that an agreement had been reached regarding the royalty issue, which would significantly reduce the royalty rate, making it possible for Pandora to stay in business. It announced, too, that free listening would be limited to 40 hours per month but can be extended to unlimited for that month for $0.99. \"The revised royalties are quite high,\" the company's blog notes, \"higher in fact than any other form of radio.\" The extended listening fee differs from \"upgrading,\" which also disables advertisements, increases the bitrate to 192 kbps, and provides a dedicated music player (as opposed to listening through browser).

Visible Path entered the market with a different way of organizing and displaying your business contacts.  Instead of showing all of your extended contacts to all the contacts in your network like LinkedIn, Visible Path focuses more on strength of relationship between contacts to determine who can add who to their contact list.  This effort precludes \"contact farmers\" from adding you simply for the sake of adding someone.  In a smaller circle of contacts, your relationships are more meaningful and cannot be as easily diluted.  In order to create this more discriminatory contact circle Visible Path collects information about all your contacts through a 6mb Microsoft Outlook plugin which tracks who you've sent emails to or have meetings with.  \r\n\r\nThe more often you are in contact with someone through Outlook, the stronger the relationship and vice versa.  People outside of Outlook can also be added to Visible Path, but must be done so by searching for them specifically.  Since contacts are generally all made through Outlook, the business relationships you make are very real.  Because Visible Path users do not have the option of seeing your extended network, a much higher percentage of your business contacts will actually be people you have conversed with.\r\n\r\nAt its current state, Visible Path's Outlook plugin is prone to simply making all your office contacts your strongest.  User's may email or have meetings with people in their office more consistently than they do with very important contacts who work for other companies or in different locations.  In these cases Visible Path would incorrectly recognize the importance of your relationships.  It's a fallacy that more contact with someone means you have a stronger relationship with them.  Visible Path is currently looking into other methods to track relationship strength.  Drawing data from phone calls and IM's is currently on their plate, but some way for the content of conversations needs to be analyzed for Visible Path to work without flaw.  Business Networks are very helpful when all your contacts are meaningful.

This application of recent trends on the web toward video makes them, in a way, the [Youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com) of used car sales.  Hotswap is funded by The Kinsey Hills Group.  Although still in pre-launch mode at this time, Hotswap recently acquired a deal with Red McCombs Automotive , which produces around $800 million a year in sales and will list every one of their used cars on Hotswap.  At this time they are also in negotiations with AutoNation. The nature of their business makes them natural competitors with [Ebay](http://www.ebay.com),  the multitude of used car sites on the web, and [Edgeio](http://www.edgeio.com), which was co-founded by TechCrunch's Mike Arrington.\r\n\r\nHotSwap was deadpooled in April 2008.", "logo_url": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/crunchbase_prod_assets/assets/images/resized/0000/3883/3883v1-max-250x250.jpg", "id": "c:311"}, {"website": "http://intensedebate.com", "city": "Boulder", "name": "IntenseDebate", "people": [["Isaac Keyet", "p:1318"], ["Jon Fox", "p:1317"], ["Michael Koenig", "p:14257"], ["Tom Keller", "p:5883"], ["David Cohen", "p:1235"], ["Austin Hallock", "p:4971"]], "twitter": null, "financial_orgs": [["Techstars", "c:362"], ["Tom Keller", "p:5883"], ["David Cohen", "p:1235"]], "summary": "Intense Debate is a blog commenting system that supports Typepad, Blogger and Wordpress blogs.

In 1989, the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) endorsed a digital technology called Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA). Just three months later, Qualcomm introduced Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), a superior technology for wireless and data products that changed the global face of wireless communications forever.\r\n\r\nToday, Qualcomm plays a central role in the rapid adoption and growth of 3G and next-generation wireless around the world.

In 1985 the company was re-named Quantum Computer Services and was the first online service launched for the Commodore 64 and 128 consoles. In 1988, the company created an online service for the PC and changed its name to AOL (America Online), becoming over the next decade the premier Online access subscription business, at one point having almost 25MM subscribers. \r\n\r\nAOL originally went public in 1992 and grew to become the largest online access and portal company on the Web. In 2000, AOL acquired Time Warner for $160B+ in what was then considered to be the largest M&A transaction, and the company was re-named AOL Time Warner. The merger was not fruitful and on May 28, 2009, Time Warner announced that it would spin off AOL into a separate public company. The spinoff occurred on December 9, 2009, ending the eight-year relationship between the two companies.\r\n\r\nSince then, AOL has focused on reinventing itself as a brand company under the guidance of CEO Tim Armstrong, creating and acquiring a range of content properties. Major acquisitions include the purchase of technology news blog TechCrunch in September 2010, and on March 7, 2011, the purchase of The Huffington Post. Other AOL brands include Moviefone, Engadget, Patch, Stylelist, MapQuest, Cambio and about.me.", "logo_url": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/crunchbase_prod_assets/assets/images/resized/0000/4003/4003v5-max-250x250.png", "id": "c:351"}, {"website": "http://www.limelight.com", "city": "Tempe", "name": "Limelight Networks", "people": [["Paul Alfieri", "p:125032"], ["Peter Galvin", "p:210538"], ["Dave Rowley", "p:1492"], ["Fred Harman", "p:23289"], ["Nathan Raciborski", "p:1469"], ["Jill Brodie", "p:192781"], ["Alexander Castro", "p:4475"], ["Allan Kaplan", "p:158530"], ["Jeff Lunsford", "p:1468"], ["Benny Fischer", "p:140802"], ["Carl Kaiser", "p:83021"], ["Kirby Wadsworth", "p:45497"], ["Tamara Monson", "p:194212"], ["David Rowley", "p:187156"], ["Matthew Hale", "p:1471"], ["Jason Thibeault", "p:154096"], ["Jon Corley", "p:143142"], ["Michael Gordon", "p:1470"], ["Tim Durnin", "p:216250"], ["Mike Sawyer", "p:19029"], ["Dan FitzSimons", "p:210537"], ["David Hatfield", "p:1472"]], "twitter": "llnw", "financial_orgs": [], "summary": "Limelight Networks, Inc.

This is easy to get around since you can buy a single print for around $0.12.\r\n\r\nMain competitors include [Flickr](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/flickr), [Zooomr](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/zooomr), [Shutterfly](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/Shutterfly), and [Photobucket](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/photobucket).", "logo_url": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/crunchbase_prod_assets/assets/images/resized/0000/4015/4015v4-max-250x250.jpg", "id": "c:354"}, {"website": "http://www.hp.com", "city": "Palo Alto", "name": "Hewlett-Packard", "people": [["Raj L Gupta", "p:97854"], ["Jake Bell", "p:132440"], ["Cheong-Tai Leung", "p:212357"], ["Dominic Lee", "p:253431"], ["Ray Thietten", "p:242254"], ["Leslie Jones", "p:247363"], ["RJ Weigel", "p:165596"], ["Ronen Yacobi", "p:91340"], ["Prakash K.

Many of the company's employees, including its COO, [Ali Aydar](http://crunchbase.com/person/ali-aydar), were veterans of the original Napster team.\r\n\r\nSNOCAP's initial focus was on developing technology content owners (in particular artists and labels) could use to register their content and set business rules controlling where and how that content is available on the web. SNOCAP eventually secured deals with all four major labels (Universal Music Group, EMI, Warner Music Group, and SonyBMG Music Entertainment) to register their content in SNOCAP's digital registry. \r\n\r\nSNOCAP's ultimate goal was to license this technology to file-sharing services, enabling a new wave of \"legal P2P\" services that used SNOCAP's technology to track and filter music sharing within a network, blocking registered content that labels & artists didn't want shared but allowing sharing of anything else. While two file-sharing services, Mashboxx and Grokster, signed up to use SNOCAP's technology, their SNOCAP-powered services never launched.\r\n\r\nIn late 2006, SNOCAP and [MySpace](http://crunchbase.com/company/myspace) announced that they were partnering to give independent artists and labels a way to sell music on MySpace through SNOCAP\u0092s MyStore widgets. Eventually, over 110,000 artists signed up to sell their music through MyStore widgets. These early experiments were a precursor to MySpace\u0092s efforts to sell downloads directly to consumers through its [MySpace Music](http://crunchbase.com/company/myspace-music) venture. \r\n\r\nIn March 2007, SNOCAP announced it was partnering with the social media site [imeem](http://crunchbase.com/company/imeem) to track music being played on the site and share ad revenue with artists and labels, utilizing SNOCAP\u0092s content fingerprinting and digital registry technology. The goal was to provide a way for consumers to upload and share music with their friends, for free, and to do so in a way where label and artists can both make money and have greater control over where and how their music was available. imeem rolled out this new offering in June 2007.\r\n\r\nIn April 2008, imeem acquired SNOCAP, confirming rumors first reported on TechCrunch two months earlier. That acquisition reunited several members of the original Napster team, including SNOCAP's then COO, Ali Aydar, who is now imeem\u0092s COO. Aydar was a key early advisor to imeem and served on its board of directors from 2003-2007.\r\n\r\nimeem continues to operate the SNOCAP digital registry, and uses the technology acquired from SNOCAP to power imeem\u0092s ad-supported streaming music service.\r\n\r\nSNOCAP was backed by Ron Conway, Morgenthaler Ventures, WaldenVC, and Court Square Ventures.

Lenders can find the business and entrepreneur they want to lend to based on region, business type, risk level, etc. Each posted loan is accompanied with bios for the respective entrepreneur, details on the why and what the loan is going to be used for, total amount raised from other lenders, loan duration (usually 6-12 months) and loan default risk. \r\n\r\nTaking small payments, usually $25, from a bunch of Kiva lenders raises the loans. Once a loan's full amount has been raised it is transferred to one of Kiva's field partners. In most cases the field partners have already disbursed the loans depicted before they are posted for \"backfilling\" by lenders on the Kiva website. Field partners are local microfinance institutions (MFIs) in developing countries that find, track and manage entrepreneurs and then disburse and collect the microloans. Even though lenders and Kiva do not charge interest, the field partners charge interest averaging 35% per year to the entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nWhen loans have been repaid in full they are transferred back to Kiva and then to Kiva lenders via PayPal. PayPal has allowed Kiva to transfer loans back-and-forth from the lenders without transaction fees partly because of Kiva's nonprofit nature and partly because of Kiva president Premal Shah's past job of being a Principal Product Manager at PayPal. \r\n\r\nKiva pioneered the concept of allowing local field partners to post individual loan stories for funding by individuals over the internet. Up until 2009 Kiva was alone in their business model of sourcing loan capital from individuals over the internet as a nonprofit entity. In 2009, the nonprofit lending platform Zidisha was founded with the purpose of reducing interest costs for borrowers by eliminating the local field partners and allowing lenders and entrepreneurs in developing to transact directly. Other p2p lending sites, like [Prosper](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/prosper), [Zopa](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/zopa) and [Lending Club](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/LendingClub), make lower-risk loans to people in the same country as for-profit entities. Online p2p lending is new and it is hard to maneuver around financial regulations to make higher-risk, international loans as a for-profit entity, which is partly why Kiva formed as a non-profit.

Zopa works in the following way: the company first categorizes borrower credit grades with an A*, A, B, C or Y rating; then lenders make offers that vary by money amount and time period for persons with a certain credit grade; and borrowers can then agree the aggregate offered rate.  Zopa takes on such responsibilities as distributing money between parties, completing the legal paperwork, performing borrower identity/credit checks, and employing a collections agency that chases missed payments for the lender.  Zopa also mitigates risk for lenders by enforcing monthly direct debit repayment, making borrowers sign a legal contract, and allowing lenders to lend small chunks of money to individual borrowers (i.e. someone lending \u00a31000 would have their money spread across say 100 borrowers).  The company itself makes money by charging a fixed fee for borrowers and 1% annual fee for lenders.  Zopa has received public acclaim as well, having been awarded CNET Technology Awards' 2006 Internet Innovation of the Year, the 2007 Webby Award for Best Banking/Bill-Paying Website, the 2008 Webby Award for Financial Services, the Banker 2007 Award for Best Internet Project and Moneywise 2009 Awards for Best Customer Service and Best Personal Loan. \r\nOne of the three initial members of the UK's Peer-to-Peer Finance Association, together with FundingCircle and RateSetter.

Originally inspired by [Friendster](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/friendster), MySpace quickly grew to become the world's largest social network, before being overtaken by [Facebook](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/facebook). User pages are highly customizable and support integration with widgets such as [Slide](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/slide) or [YouTube](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/youtube). MySpace provides users with a way to connect around content and culture. \r\n\r\nMySpace was started as a side project of the internet marketing company eUniverse (now called [Intermix Media](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/intermixmedia)) in August 2003. [Brad Greenspan](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/brad-greenspan), then founder and CEO of eUniverse oversaw the project, which was also led by [Chris DeWolfe](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-dewolfe) (later CEO), [Josh Berman](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/josh-berman), and [Tom Anderson](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tom-anderson) (soon to be President). It officially launched in January 2004.\r\n\r\nBy February 2004, MySpace reached 1 million registered users. By November 2004, that number had reached 5 million. In July, 2005 [News Corporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation) bought eUniverse (renaming it [Intermix Media](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/intermixmedia)) for $580 M, of which approximately $327 M was the valuation of MySpace. At this time, the site had 20 million registered users. In mid 2007, [News Corporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation) contemplated selling 25% of MySpace stock to [Yahoo!](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/yahoo) in a deal that would have valued the site at $12 B, though this never went through. \r\n\r\nAfter being acquired, MySpace's revenues grew rapidly, as [News Corporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation) pursued lucrative advertising deals. In August 2006, [Google](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/google) made a $900 M agreement to provide search and advertising directly on the MySpace site, which is set to expire in June 2010.\r\n\r\nIn mid 2008, MySpace participated in a major site redesign. Throughout its history, critics have often cited the chaotic and disorganized interface as a severe drawback to usability of the site. This redesign made the main page more streamlined and clean.\r\n\r\nIn late 2006, [Universal Music Group](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/universal-music-group) sued MySpace for millions in damages from copyright infringement. This suit was settled in mid 2008 by the launch of [MySpace Music](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/myspace-music), a site where users can listen to streaming songs from all sorts of artists. To supplement this venture, MySpace acquired [iLike](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/ilike) in mid 2009. MySpace had previously also launched a record label in 2005 and musicians such as Lily Allen and Sean Kingston were first discovered through MySpace.\r\n\r\nIn mid 2007, MySpace acquired [PhotoBucket](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/photobucket) for $250 M in cash, plus an additional $50 M earn-out. By late 2009, [News Corporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation) sold a 2/3 stake in [Photobucket](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/photobucket) to a group of investors valuing the company at $60 M, over 80% less than the acquisition price.\r\n\r\nSince 2008, user growth has stagnated and page views and other metrics have fallen. In April 2009, longtime CEO and co-founder [Chris DeWolfe](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-dewolfe) was replaced by [Owen Van Natta](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/owen-van-natta), in a publicized firing. President and head of product, [Tom Anderson](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tom-anderson), was kept on, but in a different position. Two months following this, MySpace announced it was laying off 30% of its workforce amounting to 420 people.\r\n\r\nIn June 2011, Myspace was acquired by Specific Media for a [reported US$35 million](http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/29/myspace-goes-to-specific-media-for-35m-ceo-is-out-press-release/). Justin Timberlake also took ownership in this acquisition and will play a strong role in Myspace's future strategy and creative direction.\r\n", "logo_url": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/crunchbase_prod_assets/assets/images/resized/0000/4414/4414v80-max-250x250.jpg", "id": "c:494"}, {"website": "http://www.inviteshare.com", "city": "Atherton", "name": "InviteShare", "people": [["Jeff Broderick", "p:77043"]], "twitter": null, "financial_orgs": [], "summary": "InviteShare links people with invites to beta services to those without.

Long duration dialogues are conversations and audio content ranging from 5 seconds to several hours. Yap specializes in accurately transcribing these dialogues for a variety of different scenarios including voicemail-to-text, conference call transcriptions, analysis of customer phone calls and voice-activated mobile messaging.\r\n\r\nThe company was a TechCrunch finalist in 2007. Their management team previously worked on Apple's iPod, Honda's navigational systems, IBM's ViaVoice, Microsoft's Tellme speech division and Nuance's Dragon products.\r\n\r\nYap white labels its SaaS platform -- i.e., Yap Speech Cloud(TM) -- to enable diverse use cases, including messaging, call analytics and voicemail-to-text. For example, Microsoft uses Yap for voice-based mobile messaging applications. Their end users can say anything they want to and have Yap's platform transcribe it into text (far more convenient than typing on the fumbling with a devices keypad while driving). MetroPCS also is a Yap customer. Cincinnati Bell, a regional carrier, uses Yap-based technology to convert subscriber voicemails into text. The carrier was a competitive win away from SpinVox (now Nuance). Part of the allure for Yap's service is that it's completely automated. That means there is no need for humans listening to messages, typing them out, and then sending them back out, giving Yap a real advantage in ensuring privacy. Because Yap is completely machine powered, the company is able to offer lower costs, higher speeds and greater consistency.", "logo_url": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/crunchbase_prod_assets/assets/images/resized/0000/0043/43v1-max-250x250.png", "id": "c:625"}, {"website": "http://frazr.com", "city": null, "name": "Frazr", "people": [], "twitter": null, "financial_orgs": [["European Founders Fund", "f:319"]], "summary": "Softwareplusindia is a dedicated servers & dedicated servers company .Dedicated servers give you total control of your web hosting environment, and are perfect for small businesses; dedicated server web hosting is typically advantageous for businesses that require more space or control over their web sites.

Currently, the dominant lead generation model is mostly a lose-lose scenario for the consumer and real estate agent.  This model typically entails the consumer providing their contact info blindly, having no real idea what is being done with it.  Their info is then sold to one or more agents, and the agent pays up front for the lead.  The consumer is then contacted by these agents, all of which they know absolutely nothing about, except that they are probably in close proximity to them.  For the agent, payment is made prior to generating any revenue.  It's likely that the lead will not convert to a deal for the agent.  For the agent, it's a game of chance.  Buy enough leads and if one converts, it more than pays for the leads that didn't.  This model is extremely inefficient with respect to the needs/goals of both the consumer and the agent.  RealEstate.com is closing down their version of this model because it simply is not profitable.\r\rBy bringing transparency to the interaction between consumer and agent, AgentMatch aims to turn the existing lead generation paradigm on it's head, creating a win-win situation for the consumer and agent.  Consumers are able to thoroughly research agents in their area, using search criteria that includes commission, location, sales history, services offered, experience level, and the estimated value of the home they are selling or buying.  AgentMatch allows consumers to see meaningful data about an agent including number of years licensed, distance from the consumer, number of deals the agent has closed in the last 36 months, the agent's thirty-six month sales history plotted on a map, along with individual transaction details including address, date sold, and selling price, the agent's thirty-six month high, average, and low selling prices, services offered to sellers and buyers, respectively, and the agent's commission and estimated fee based on the consumer's property value.  Consumers decide when they want to talk with an agent by requesting that an agent contact them.\r\rConsumers pay nothing for the AgentMatch service, and an agent can only access the consumer's contact info if the consumer requests that the agent contact them.

Previous products by Jive include [Clearspace](http://www.jivesoftware.com/beyond/clearspace), [Jive Forums](http://www.jivesoftware.com/beyond/forums), and the now open source [Openfire](http://www.igniterealtime.org) & [Spark](http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/spark/index.jsp). \r\n\r\nThe company is focused on solutions to increase team and work productivity. Jive makes it easy for groups to brainstorm, share ideas and see what everyone is working on. The product includes team member blogs, wiki-docs for group editing and discussion tools. Recent versions include video, analytics, and social media monitoring.\r\n\r\nJive also helps companies like Intel create highly-interactive online communities.

So our timing to grow the business and bring it to profitability through even the smallest amount of additional funding could not have been worse.\r\n\r\nSo, while we sit here at the precipice of profitability, the negative marketplace forces are too strong to overcome, and we must take this regrettable action.\r\n\r\nIt remains undeniable that the publishing industry MUST find a new model, and mass collaboration and participation in the media property is certainly now proven it can be the foundation of this new model (NOTE: This is NOT citizen journalism).\r\n\r\nWe\u0092ve cracked the code on marshaling a community around a media property online and in print\u0085.and helping them become active , loyal, and engaged participants in both.\r\n\r\nWe do owe a debt of thanks to Minor Ventures for believing in us, and funding us to this point and to have even given us a chance to make this business successful, and for that confidence we\u0092ll always be grateful.\u0094\r\n\r\nIn February 2009, the assets of 8020 Publishing LLC (dba 8020 Media) were acquired by 8020 Media, Inc., a new entity established to revive JPG (Mag) and Everywhere, for an undisclosed amount.\r\n\r\nSince the acquisition, JPG has released 6 new issues (via print-on-demand partnership with HP division MagCloud) and grown its registered user community to nearly 260,000.\r\n\r\nWith over 2 million uploaded photos and nearly 500,000 global unique visitors, JPG has continued to raise the bar on the quality of digital photography shared online.

Reservations are received throughout the day, the clustering engine is run at 4 PM, and then users are provided with their mixer assignments telling them where to go and who they will meet at the specified time.  The user simply makes an online reservation and Mix does the rest.  Upon arrival at the mixer users can locate each other with any of three methods: visual identification, physical table markers, and electronic message delivery.  Typical venues would include bars, coffee shops, restaurants, and other commercial/public locations. For maximum convenience, users can make reservations, receive confirmations, and perform mixer check-in via cell phone.   \r\n\r\nMix is free to join and there are no membership or annual subscription fees.

For example, Mix has initiated discussions with Eons.com to license its technology in a common interest application for the 50+ crowd.

Kaltura's features and products enable easy deployment of custom work-flows involving video creation, ingestion, publishing, management, syndication, engagement, monetization and analysis.  The free community-supported self-hosted software and source-code is available for download at www.kaltura.org.

Our open source cost structure coupled with our large and fast growing customer base enables us to deliver these services at competitive pricing, and provide customer with several main benefits:\r\n\r\n- No vendor lock-in - setting up a video platform and integrating it into existing workflows takes time and money, regardless of which platform you use - Kaltura is open source, so you're not locked in with a certain vendor, you have full access to the source code and can always continue to use the code, and your time and effort will never be wasted.\r\n\r\n- SaaS vs. On Prem - Kaltura is the only platform that can be deployed as a hosted solution (like the other platforms in the market), or as a self-hosted platform behind your own firewall. This provides full security and control for organizations that have an on premise deployment policy. You can also select a hybrid of the two, and migrate from SaaS to On Prem.\r\n\r\n- Application Exchange - Kaltura is the only provider that has an Application Exchange - a marketplace of add-ons, plug-ins, and applications that enhance the platform.\r\n\r\n- Highest level of: FLEXIBILITY - open source code that can be tweaked and changed according to specific needs.\r\n\r\n- Fastest pace of: INNOVATION - due to our global open source community of more than 10,000 members.\r\n\r\n- EASIEST integration with existing systems - Kaltura's platform is modular and designed to fit into your existing systems and workflows.
