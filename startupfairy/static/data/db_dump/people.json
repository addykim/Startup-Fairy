To imagine a single person that starts with a simple idea and then turns that idea into a permanent monument of human accomplishment - that is beautiful. To imagine a single human being having the guts to hold themselves responsible for affecting so many lives through employment, through their product and through the shear, raw, and direct power of money - that is my kind of benevolence. To see a person stand up and attempt greatness in the face of such overwhelming mediocrity in today's world - that is courage.\r\n\r\nI have seen the best and the worst that being an entrepreneur can offer. I've seen revenues grew from $20 million to over $3.6 billion. I've ridden the roller coaster of going public seeing our stock rise by 856% only to come crashing back down by 900%. I've taken on Google at their height of power and convinced 72 other to join me. I've made many decisions that made people love me, but more importantly I made a few difficult calls that I knew were right even though I knew it would make some hate me. Regardless of the perils, the risks and the loneliness that entrepreneurs often face, I know that my path is to create, to build and to take something that perhaps only I can see and make it work. It is ingrained my bones and my heart. I am a capitalist and I am an entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nTo me, there is hardly anything more difficult, more worthy or more inspiring than being a founder.  What defines us is that despite the risks, the fears and the fact that almost all who try fail, we, by our own volition, start companies with the intent of changing the world.  And we do so not as the consumers or dependancies of the initial spark that ultimately creates value, but rather as the producers, the irreducible primaries, of it.  As such, our evolutionary path, our successes and our failures, not only affects us, but also radiates out to the entire startup ecosystem with which we share co-dependencies.\r\n\r\nYet, despite the importance of our quest, our path is rarely made easier by our own kind.  We, the founder cognoscenti, are so rapt with our own efforts that we rarely lift our head, or rather our minds to help our own brethren.  We, the great producers of value, seem to flip becoming the consumer of knowledge rather than the producer of it.  As a result, we unwittingly end up stifling our brethren instead of helping them in ways that seem obvious. \r\n\r\nWhile founders may have no formal leader, no formal structure and our borders may be unbound by geography, doctrine or rules, we are, in fact, a community.  To create a shared sense of our current state through the fearless act of sharing knowledge or taking a position is what binds us together.  To do so declares our state and consummates our union.  To repudiate such an attempt abdicates our responsibility to one another, contradicts our nature as producers and inures us to a solitary existence where we set ourselves adrift in what is already tempestuous waters.\r\n\r\nIn a world which irrationally values quips over explanations, summation over detail, kind of getting it versus really getting it, it is essential to recognize the need for depth when depth is necessary.  So however long, flawed or perilous my essays and writings may be, and even though my wife has grave concerns for the english language when put in my hands, if just one founder is able to extract a single shred of knowledge that completes a circuit, then it was worth it.", "logo_url": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/crunchbase_prod_assets/assets/images/resized/0003/5446/35446v4-max-250x250.jpg", "id": "p:107"}, {"city": null, "name": "Lorenzo Thione", "twitter": "thione", "companies": [{"role": "Founder / Product Architect", "name": "Powerset", "id": "c:30"}, {"role": "Board of Directors", "name": "Ibrii", "id": "c:21279"}, {"role": "Advisor", "name": "8coupons", "id": "c:2513"}, {"role": "Investor", "name": "Kidlandia", "id": "c:22462"}, {"role": "Investor", "name": "Etacts", "id": "c:42424"}, {"role": "Founder / Board of Director", "name": "StartOut", "id": "c:50163"}, {"role": "Advisor", "name": "Doochoo", "id": "c:46333"}, {"role": "Board member", "name": "Searcheeze", "id": "c:76666"}, {"role": "Partner", "name": "Ingk Labs", "id": "c:42590"}, {"role": "Advisor", "name": "Hyperfair", "id": "c:86284"}, {"role": "Founder, President & Chairman", "name": "Artify It", "id": "c:156403"}], "summary": "Lorenzo Thione is the co-founder of Powerset, Inc., an innovative search startup founded in 2005, with the vision of bringing to consumers a more natural and effective type of Internet search than conventional keyword search.

VictorOps is Todd?s third ?from-the-ground-up? start-up, and this time it?s personal.\r\n\r\nTodd?s prior two companies were both highly transactional SAS businesses generating significant ?revenue-by-the-second.? There?s an old saying, ?when mama?s not happy, nobody is happy.? Todd?s version of this sentiment is, ?when the platform is down, we aren?t generating revenue.? Todd isn?t much of a poet.\r\n\r\nTodd?s early opinions on operations were forged over a decade ago at Raindance Communications, a web conferencing company where Todd was Founder and CEO. At the time Raindance had one major customer, Wells Fargo, and the weekend of Super Bowl XXXIV was a weekend he?ll never forget. Late that Friday night in 2000, the small development and ops teams were working through a routine network upgrade when much-to-the-team?s-dismay, the platform wouldn?t come back up. Over the next 72 hours Todd learned an important lesson: don?t activate the entire technical team at once. Some problems take longer to fix and after 24 hours of debugging, fallen soldiers need to be replaced. The corrupt boot file was finally located but nobody was able to watch the St. Louis Rams beat the Tennessee Titans. Raindance went public later that year (RNDC), and Todd remained Founder and CTO until it sold to West Corporation in 2006 for over $170M.\r\n\r\nAfter Raindance, Todd became the Founder and CEO of Lijit Networks, an online advertising company. Lijit built a real-time ad exchange to help online publishers of all sizes sell their unsold ad inventory. In 2012 Lijit performed over 1B real-time ad transactions per day, which required 23 cloud locations and nearly every cloud provider to deliver on such a massive ad serving infrastructure. Lijit was generating over $35M in annual revenue when Todd sold the company to Federated Media Publishing in October 2011. The acquisition was widely recognized as one the most significant outcomes in Colorado over the past 10 years.\r\n\r\nPrior to becoming a serial entrepreneur, Todd built hardware and software to test experimental aircraft at NASA, and developed systems to automatically provision telephony services for some the nation?s largest RBOC?s.\r\n\r\nFollow Todd on Twitter @ToddVernon https://twitter.com/toddvernon and read his personal blog, False Precision http://falseprecision.typepad.com/.", "logo_url": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/crunchbase_prod_assets/assets/images/resized/0022/7387/227387v2-max-250x250.jpg", "id": "p:202"}, {"city": null, "name": "Joshua Schachter", "twitter": "joshu", "companies": [{"role": "Founder", "name": "delicious", "id": "c:75"}, {"role": "Founder", "name": "geoURL", "id": "c:4216"}, {"role": "Member of Technical Staff", "name": "Google", "id": "c:59"}, {"role": "CEO", "name": "Tasty Labs", "id": "c:60671"}, {"role": "Investor", "name": "Gengo", "id": "c:18260"}], "summary": "Joshua Schachter is the founder of [delicious], a popular bookmark-sharing service founded in late 2003 and acquired by [Yahoo] in 2005. \r\n\r\nIn January 2009 Joshua Schachter [joined Google].\r\n\r\nJoshua also created [geoURL], a location-URL reverse directory, and was a co-creator of [Memepool].", "logo_url": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/crunchbase_prod_assets/assets/images/resized/0001/0709/10709v1-max-250x250.jpg", "id": "p:203"}, {"city": null, "name": "Stan James", "twitter": null, "companies": [{"role": "Founder & CTO", "name": "Lijit Networks", "id": "c:1896"}], "summary": null, "logo_url": null, "id": "p:204"}, {"city": null, "name": "Brad Feld", "twitter": "bfeld", "companies": [{"role": "Board Member", "name": "Techstars", "id": "c:362"}, {"role": "Managing Director", "name": "Foundry Group", "id": "f:745"}, {"role": "Managing Director", "name": "Mobius Venture Capital", "id": "f:25"}, {"role": "Board Member", "name": "Gnip", "id": "c:3208"}, {"role": "Board Member", "name": "Zynga", "id": "c:1812"}, {"role": "Board Member", "name": "Gist", "id": "c:22537"}, {"role": "Board Member", "name": "NewsGator", "id": "c:523"}, {"role": "Board Member", "name": "Rally Software", "id": "c:6306"}, {"role": "Board Member", "name": "StillSecure", "id": "c:14888"}, {"role": "Board Member", "name": "FeedBurner", "id": "c:155"}, {"role": "Director", "name": "Oblong Industries", "id": "c:41165"}, {"role": "Director", "name": "BigDoor", "id": "c:33965"}, {"role": "Co-Chairman", "name": "Startup Colorado", "id": "c:146445"}, {"role": "Director", "name": "Orbotix", "id": "c:56256"}, {"role": "Board Member", "name": "Fitbit", "id": "c:10015"}, {"role": "Board Member", "name": "Standing Cloud", "id": "c:61783"}, {"role": "Board Member", "name": "Application Developers Alliance", "id": "c:174763"}, {"role": "Board Member", "name": "FullContact", "id": "c:82668"}, {"role": null, "name": "Occipital", "id": "c:9833"}, {"role": null, "name": "seomoz.org", "id": "c:177123"}, {"role": "Board Member", "name": "Yesware", "id": "c:84959"}, {"role": "Board Member", "name": "MobileDay", "id": "c:160861"}, {"role": "Board Member", "name": "Cheezburger", "id": "c:13129"}, {"role": "Managing Director", "name": "Intensity Ventures", "id": "f:11645"}, {"role": "Managing Director", "name": "Softbank Technology Ventures", "id": "f:11646"}, {"role": "Executive", "name": "AmeriData", "id": "c:221312"}, {"role": "President", "name": "Feld Technologies", "id": "c:221313"}, {"role": "Director", "name": "Rover.com", "id": "c:145478"}, {"role": "mentor", "name": "Founder's Co-op", "id": "f:1017"}, {"role": "Board Member", "name": "Harmonix Music Systems", "id": "c:3873"}, {"role": "Board Member", "name": "Kato", "id": "c:218873"}, {"role": "Board Member", "name": "Modular Robotics", "id": "c:44726"}, {"role": "Board Member", "name": "JumpCloud", "id": "c:223736"}, {"role": "Board Member", "name": "Moz", "id": "c:960"}, {"role": "Board Member", "name": "Return Path", "id": "c:13084"}, {"role": "Board Member", "name": "littleBits Electronics", "id": "c:144237"}], "summary": "Brad has been an early stage investor and entrepreneur since 1987.

Not one to shy from controversy, his quest to offer competing products and innovative technologies has brought him face to face with corporate giants \u0096 and corporate lawsuits. But his madness always has a method \u0096 producing relevant technology and products that bring choice and freedom back to the consumer. Be it MP3, Linux, software, or hardware, Michael has built his career on supporting open standards that empower consumers. With companies like Linspire, SIPphone, and MP3tunes, Michael has entered industries that traditionally had only one or two dominant players. But with each industry he tackles, Michael's end goal is trying to bring competition and freedom of choice back to the marketplace. And restoring that freedom is the undercurrent of every venture he helms.\r\n\r\nMichael's high-profile startups include MP3.com, where he established the largest collection of digital music in the world, amassing more than 1 million downloadable MP3 files. Robertson also spearheaded change in corporate business music services and put the power of CD creation in artists' hands by offering a host of support technologies and services. Vivendi Universal purchased the profitable company in 2001 for $372 million in stock and cash.\r\n\r\nMichael's next project was to produce an easy-to-use product that could handily compete with operating systems like Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. Having used Linux at MP3.com, Michael decided to start Linspire, Inc., a company that produces an affordable, license-free desktop Linux operating system that quickly gained market share on Microsoft Windows. Four years after its founding, the Linspire operating system made inroads in North America, Europe, Latin America, and the Pacific Rim as the easiest Linux distribution available.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Robertson founded SIPphone.com (renamed Gizmo5), a company that harnesses the power of the Internet to allow customers to make free long distance phone calls. SIPphone was founded to build a VoIP platform and directory on which any hardware or software developer could offer free VoIP service. Since then the company has partnered with Web communities, universities, telcos and hardware manufacturers around the world to extend and strengthen its VoIP platform. Today Gizmo5's service incorporates all the key elements of VoIP service.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Michael reentered the MP3 business with MP3tunes, a Music Service Provider (MSP). MP3tunes is the home of MP3tunes Locker, the only secure, online music space to feature unlimited listening. With just a couple clicks, Locker users sync up their own music collections to enjoy through any web browser and a growing number of home entertainment and mobile devices.\r\n\r\nAn active supporter of higher education, Michael launched REEF (Robertson Educational Empowerment Foundation) in the fall of 2002 at the University of California, San Diego. REEF is a non-profit organization that is dedicated to promoting new and innovative programs of investment in education.\r\n\r\nPrior to establishing MP3.com as a major portal of music distribution, Michael operated several web sites from 1995 to March 1998 that focused on merging search technologies with commerce. Michael received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Cognitive Science from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in 1990.", "logo_url": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/crunchbase_prod_assets/assets/images/resized/0005/5672/55672v3-max-250x250.jpg", "id": "p:261"}, {"city": null, "name": "Avi Shechter", "twitter": null, "companies": [{"role": "Co-founder and CEO", "name": "fring Ltd", "id": "c:95"}, {"role": "Advisor", "name": "Yedda", "id": "c:1278"}, {"role": "Co-CEO", "name": "ICQ", "id": "c:13020"}], "summary": "CEO and co-founder Avi Shechter joined fring from venture capitalist firm Veritas in 2006.

BBM is a boutique social networking design and platform shop - specializing in building systems that support the open stack, custom semi-private networks and strategic thinking.\r\n\r\nMarc is an advocate of open social networking, open standards and what he calls the \u0091open mesh\u0091. A speaker and panel moderator at many conferences around the world, Marc is not afraid to ask the hard questions which highlight the desire for users to control their own data and software developers to not be locked into web 1.0 strategies.\r\n\r\nMarc was the co-founder of MacroMind, which became Macromedia. While with MacroMind Marc helped develop:\r\n\r\n- the world\u0092s first multimedia player - now known as Flash, originally called Shockwave. The original player was the VideoWorkls player - first created in Dec. 1984. Every Macintosh shipped with a player disc from 1986.\r\n\r\n- the world\u0092s first multimedia authoring system. Before MacroMind multimedia was craeted by programming. MacroMind helped introduce (along with Apple\u0092s Hypercard) the notion of end-user \u0091authoring\u0091 - where a simple scripting langauge and a timeline notional system were utilized to get images, sounds, animations and video synchronized and interactive - over time. First available in 1987.\r\n\r\n- the world\u0092s first cross-platform authoring system - popularizing the notion of \u0093author once, play back many places\u0093. Content developers could create their interactive applications once, and play them back on Macintoshs or PCs.

I am also a limited partner in many other venture funds which have their own startup investments. \r\n\r\nBecause of these investments, if there's a startup there's a good chance I'm a direct or indirect investor in it. Many times I won't even know that I'm an investor, because venture funds that I invest in don't normally share non public information with limited partners.\r\n\r\nAlso, CrunchFund's investors include AOL and many of the top tier venture funds.\r\n\r\nThat means I invest in a lot of startups. And I invest in a lot of venture funds. And a lot of venture funds have invested in me.\r\n\r\nI also occasionally own public company stocks. I currently own shares of Facebook. Until recently I owned shares of AOL. I also own other public company stocks through the management of a third party, although I typically don't know about those investments and they are primarily not in the tech industry.\r\n\r\nSometimes I have so many financial conflicts of interest that I can't even keep them straight.\r\n\r\nSo when you read what I write on Uncrunched, TechCrunch or wherever, understand that I'm conflicted. A lot.\r\n\r\nHow do I [deal with this and still write](http://uncrunched.com/2012/02/22/look-this-is-what-it-comes-down-to/)?\r\n\r\nI addressed it in one of my [first posts on Uncrunched](http://uncrunched.com/2011/09/25/what-exactly-is-uncrunched/) in 2011:\r\n\r\n\"Here are the things you can expect from me:\r\n\r\n- TRANSPARENCY: I will disclose, as I've always done, all financial conflicts of interest (I have lots and lots of those). I'll also disclose other conflicts of interest, like friendships, when I can. I know a lot of you don't understand why I can't disclose all conflicts of interest. The answer is that if I did, not that many people would want to talk to me in the direct, honest way that I prefer. As a reader you must remain aware of the inherent bias in everything you read, and form your own opinions accordingly. Read [this post on TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/07/tech-press-screw-them-all/) and the links for more about how I see the world.\r\n\r\n- TRUTH: I always try to find the truth in a situation. That unvarnished, pure nugget of truth at the core of every issue that I write about. Sometimes this takes more than one post, and sometimes I have to go back and correct things I've gotten wrong. I'll continue to do that. For more on this, read my post about [process journalism](http://techcrunch.com/2009/06/07/the-morality-and-effectiveness-of-process-journalism/).\r\n\r\n- BIAS: I have lots of it, and I never try to ignore it or hide from it. The main thing to know about me is that I'm a champion of entrepreneurs and the startups they build. They are my rock stars. If in doubt I side with them, and that's clear from my writing. For more on this, read my ll always disclose the conflict of interest directly in that post.\r\n\r\n", "logo_url": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/crunchbase_prod_assets/assets/images/resized/0001/2794/12794v6-max-250x250.jpg", "id": "p:904"}, {"city": null, "name": "Paul Forster", "twitter": null, "companies": [{"role": "Senior Advisor and Co-founder", "name": "Indeed", "id": "c:249"}], "summary": null, "logo_url": null, "id": "p:905"}, {"city": null, "name": "Rony Kahan", "twitter": null, "companies": [{"role": "Co-founder & CEO", "name": "Indeed", "id": "c:249"}, {"role": "Partner", "name": "Capital Factory", "id": "f:2186"}], "summary": "Rony Kahan is the CEO and co-founder of Indeed, the world's leading job site.

His father, Jimmy, worked as a grocery store manager, while his mother, Doris, and his grandmother, Erma, ran the House of Learning, a small private school in the tradition of the one-room schoolhouse, where Wales and his three siblings received their early education. As a child, Wales was a keen reader with an acute intellectual curiosity. During an interview in 2005 with Brian Lamb, in what he credits to the influence of the Montessori method on the school?s philosophy of education, Wales said he had \"spent lots of hours poring over the Britannicas and World Book Encyclopedias\". There were only four other children in Wales? grade, so the school grouped together the first through fourth grade students and the fifth through eighth grade students. As an adult, Wales was sharply critical of the government?s treatment of the school, citing the ?constant interference and bureaucracy and very sort of snobby inspectors from the state? as a formative influence on his political philosophy. \r\n\r\nAfter eighth grade, Wales attended Randolph School, a university-preparatory school in Huntsville, graduating at sixteen. Wales said that the school was expensive for his family, but that \"education was always a passion in my household... you know, the very traditional approach to knowledge and learning and establishing that as a base for a good life.\" \r\n\r\nHe received his bachelor?s degree in finance from Auburn University. Wales then entered the PhD finance program at the University of Alabama before leaving with a master's degree to enter the PhD finance program at Indiana University. \r\n\r\nHe taught at both universities during his postgraduate studies but did not write the doctoral dissertation required for a PhD, something he ascribed to boredom.\r\n\r\nIn 1996, he and two partners founded Bomis, a male-oriented web portal featuring entertainment and adult content.
