We will, as a result, be able to quickly identify opportunities to contribute to the development of your company whether you need to round out your management team, connect with a potential customer, or find a strategic partner.

They truly understand the challenges of entrepreneurial teams and have a lot of experience helping businesses scale to their potential. Jafco Ventures know how best to be very actively engaged when needed and they also know when it is best to simply provide encouragement from the sidelines. In addition, for those companies where it applies, we have the additional highly differentiated added value component of a proven business development team based in Tokyo, whose sole purpose is to aggressively pursue substantial revenue opportunities for their portfolio companies in a very time-efficient manner. This team of professionals has an extensive network of strategic relationships that very effectively leverage the JAFCO franchise value in Japan and other parts of Asia. As many of their portfolio companies will gladly testify, at JAFCO Ventures, their definition of value-add is quite tangible and readily measurable.\r\n\r\nInvestment Process: Since JAFCO Ventures are organized to work collectively as a team on each deal, they pride themselves on their responsiveness to entrepreneurs and commit to making investment decisions in a very timely manner. JAFCO Ventures is the lead investor in almost all of their financings since they have the expertise to determine valuation, set sensible terms and align the interests of all the investors and management in their deal structures.

The problem is even more acute when runway extension can be the difference between meeting milestones and achieving an upround or not. MMV provides entrepreneurs with an alternative to address this problem. They have a range of creative debt financing approaches that enable a company to get the best of both worlds: additional capital with limited dilution.\r\n\r\nA major benefit of MMV is that they deploy their capital quickly and efficiently. Their goal is to make the process as user friendly for their companies as possible. They believe that management time is better spent building their business rather than fundraising. What this means is that typically, upon signing a term sheet, they are able to complete a transaction and provide capital within four weeks. As well, they do not require board representation nor the renegotiation of the shareholder's agreement.\r\n\r\nAnother major advantage of MMV is that they do not require any financial covenants or guarantees from companies or management teams they provide capital to. This means as an entrepreneur, you get full access to their capital to grow your business, and don't have to worry about tripping a covenant and the resulting negative impact on your business.\r\n\r\nThey operate in the technology and life sciences sectors. Their key criteria being that a company has a proprietary product or process that is needed by its customers and clearly differentiates itself from its competitors. Within technology they have been most active in the software and communications arenas. Within life sciences they provide financing to both drug development companies and medical device companies.\r\n\r\nThey have financed a range of companies from those at the pre-product stage of their development to those with over $90 million in annual revenue. Their situations may be different but their underlying need for quick access to less dilutive capital is the same. For example, an early stage company may need additional runway to complete its product and start customer trials before going for its next round of financing. A later stage company may face a circumstance where the IPO window has closed and it needs additional working capital for expanding its business as it waits for the public markets to open. A publicly traded company may need access to capital to complete an acquisition but feels its stock price is depressed. Rather than undertake the time consuming process of completing a road show with institutions to raise additional equity, MMV can quickly provide less dilutive capital allowing management to remain focused on the business.\r\n\r\nMMV Financial\u0092s business is built on providing a range of creative financing solutions that allow growing companies fast and efficient access to additional capital with limited dilution.\r\n\r\n", "logo_url": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/crunchbase_prod_assets/assets/images/resized/0002/9395/29395v3-max-250x250.jpg", "id": "f:331"}, {"website": "http://www.tugboatventures.com", "city": "Palo Alto", "name": "Tugboat Ventures", "twitter": null, "companies": [["Qwiki", "c:56989"], ["MATRIXX Software", "c:43665"], ["Aria Systems", "c:3182"], ["SayNow", "c:705"], ["SavvyMoney, Inc.", "c:39322"], ["Education Elements", "c:151453"], ["RepairPal", "c:1287"], ["Risk I/O", "c:44700"], ["Cuil", "c:856"], ["GoalSpring Financial", "c:51533"], ["Alminder", "c:189002"], ["Atzip", "c:67910"], ["Ifeelgoods", "c:57091"], ["Koozoo", "c:181166"], ["Mamapedia", "c:23940"], ["RichRelevance", "c:4091"], ["Mahoot Games", "c:145649"]], "summary": "Tugboat Ventures is a venture capital firm specializing in investments in consumer Internet, enterprise software-as-a-service, mobility, and the next generation of online advertising companies.

We serve the founders and investors who have chosen us as their partners, and help them to build large, successful businesses.\r\n\r\nGreycroft was founded in 2006 based on two realizations.  First, advances in technology have allowed companies to scale with less direct investment.  Second, large venture funds have a tendency to over-capitalize early stage companies, eliminating many likely exit opportunities.  This is not done in a malicious way, but it is the natural outcome of large fund economics.  These two realizations led us to create a new type of venture firm that was intentionally small but had the network and access of a first tier venture fund.\r\n\r\nWe set out to prove this concept in 2006, raising $75 million from corporate executives around the world.  Our first fund made 34 investments, including many successful business and consumer-focused companies, and is now among the top performing venture capital funds of its vintage.  In 2010 Greycroft closed its second fund with an additional $130 million, including many of the same investors, as well as participation from leading institutions.  The mission, team, and strategy remain the same.\r\n\r\nGreycroft invests between $500,000 and $5 million at inception, and will increase on a staged basis to double that amount over time.  We invest alone or alongside other firms, and will accept a board seat when appropriate, although a board seat is not a prerequisite when syndicating with others.\r\n\r\nOur portfolio companies benefit from active, hands-on assistance in all phases of expansion, including marketing, finance, and management development.

Moore, named after Bacon's middle name, is a $10 billion global macro set of hedge funds. The next few funds we will be covering are global macro oriented funds, which is a switch from some of the more value oriented funds we've been covering, like the 'Tiger Cub' funds including Stephen Mandel's Lone Pine Capital, Lee Ainslie's Maverick Capital, John Griffin's Blue Ridge Capital , and Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global. Global macro funds seek to find investments in whatever market they can gain an edge, whether it be equities, bonds, currencies, debt, commodities, and more. So, keep in mind that these equity positions only represent a portion of the fund's overall holdings. They are not required to disclose holdings outside of equities, notes, and stock options.\r\n\r\nLouis Bacon is a famed trader and risk manager. He comes from the group of \"offspring\" of the legendary Commodities Corp. Bacon emerged as one of the great macro traders alongside the likes of Paul Tudor Jones (Tudor Investment Corp), and Bruce Kovner (Caxton Associates). And, interestingly enough, Bacon helped get his firm off the ground when Paul Tudor Jones stopped accepting capital from investors and instead turned them to Bacon's firm. Returning 31% annually since inception in 1990, Bacon can be very proud of his flagship fund, Moore Global Investments, but, it doesn't stop there, as his returns have shown little correlation to the stock market and low volatility. He is the definition of a risk manager.\r\n\r\nBacon credits his risk management skills to the futures markets, where he learned to be sensitive to market action. And, he learned such skills at an early age. While getting his MBA at Columbia, he used his student loan money to trade. And, he lost it all. Clearly, he learned a lesson he would never forget. Such a lesson stuck with him as he worked various jobs in the financial industry before eventually starting his own firm. And, in his first year managing Moore Capital Management, he returned 86%.

The Center's mission is to inspire entrepreneurism and catalyze commercialization of UCSD inventions through grants, education and business mentoring.\r\n\r\nCommercializing early stage technologies is a very difficult and long process. However, in six years, the von Liebig Center has achieved remarkable results: it has received more than 200 proposals and invested more than $3.8M in seed grants and advisory services to over 70 projects. These projects have resulted in more than 22 license agreements and helped launch 16 start-up companies. In turn, those start-ups have attracted more than $78 million in subsequent capital from the private sector and created over 130 new jobs.\r\n\r\nThe Center mentors a broad range of projects in areas including medical devices/diagnostics, software, and clean technologies. These projects result in companies and products with far-reaching impacts for sustainability, healthcare and other areas that ultimately improve quality of life. Examples include an improved screening test for the human papillomavirus associated with cervical cancer, technologies that improve the treatment of shock and acute inflammatory diseases, alternative power sources based on heat to electricity conversion and next generation energy efficient lighting devices.\r\n\r\nThe Center's popular entrepreneurism courses have attracted over 400 graduate and undergraduate students, some of whom have also completed internships with the Center. Many of these von Liebig alumni have gone on to successful careers as entrepreneurs or business development professionals where they foster a culture of innovation and cooperation across disciplines.

They concentrate on companies located in Southern California and the Southwest, particularly San Diego, where they believe there is a significant shortage of venture capital. Their objective is to generate significant capital appreciation through a balanced portfolio of first and later stage equity investments in carefully selected, wisely shepherded growth companies.\r\n\r\nFirst stage companies are those with products that incorporate a disruptive technology, that are (or are about to be) commercially released, and that are capable of creating a valuable new paradigm in their category. In particular, Shepherd Ventures look for companies with completed products, where sales channels have been defined, and when possible, validated by a purchase order or letter of intent from a bona fide customer. Companies should exhibit a sustainable competitive advantage that will drive them to market or sector dominance and a credible path to profitability. Investments in these companies may be part of the first or second round of institutional capital. Seed stage opportunities will generally not be considered.\r\n\r\nLater stage companies are those that either have received prior rounds of venture capital, or have achieved growth and operational maturity without venture funding. These companies would be established technology companies with existing revenue and proven management teams.
